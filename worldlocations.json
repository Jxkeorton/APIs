It is possible to hike down the brambly slope to left for a lower exit. This lower exit is 180ft, awkward, full of brambles and just generally shitty, but doable nonetheless. Only jumpable at very low tides. The hike back up is below the third car park east of this exit and is only accessible from this beach at spring low tides. The bit to watch out for is the protruding rocky section below the red, crumbling cliff near the hike out - if you can make it around that without swimming, you should be good.",

A path starts here which will pass under the pillar. After passing it, simply reach the top by going up a thalweg and head towards the exit. To start from the ledge, and when you are facing the void, you have to turn right and find a relatively easy place to de-climb. From the very top, it is better to start from the left side, where the ledge advances the least and where running is possible.",

You just have to continue climbing for around ten meters to arrive on the promontory. The main exit is on the left. The main exit is oriented to the left (Southeast trend), because it offers the best compromise during an incident to find an emergency landing. In the corner a lot of exits are skipped, but this one with this orientation remains the one which gives the most margins/easiness to pose.

With a 4x4 you can reach the top of the exit. From there the path is well marked with stones. There is a down climbing rope next to the exit (about 5’). The walk takes 1 hour or if you’re dropped off the driver can pick you up at the landing site (Plana del Lluis). From Plana del Lluis: Look for a small road that exits the parking lot (to the right of the meadow, looking that the wall) and follow it staying on the right. It will take you to a small channel which will take you to the top near the exit, marked with a stone, where you will find an old affixed rope you can use to look over the edge. - From the observatory: Continue to the road until you find a very large stone marker, this is where you descend down a level so you can skirt the wall to the right (same as if you ascend from Plana del Lluis)",
